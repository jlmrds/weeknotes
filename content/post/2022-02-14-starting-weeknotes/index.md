# My first weeknotes entry

I'm writing weeknotes. What are they? I'm still not sure. I like the idea of having a personal blog to keep track of my work though, and I love the way R Markdown documents knit together. I'm writing these notes using the **blogdown** package and making a website for them. Maybe I'll host them somewhere online - if you're reading this, you'll know if I have or not. 

Probably I'll stick them on a website with github pages or Netlify. It should be fun!

# Why am I writing weeknotes?

Writing helps to consolidate knowledge, and I like the casual tone of weeknotes compared to formal reviews. When I think about work, I don't think of a list of tasks completed, but the human element that links them together. The motivation, lessons learned etc. and how they relate to my personal growth. I think that exploring my work in this very human way will make me better at my job, and I'm hoping it might make my job feel more fulfilling, too.

It's Monday but I was so excited to try this out that I decided to write notes for last week, today.

I was feeling rotten last week. I have had covid, which I didn't realise until Wednesday, and made me feel like I was wading in tar all week. Still, it wasn't totally unproductive. 


# In the R Dungeon

I've got a sort of split in my workload at the moment, which I like to characterise as being in the **R Dungeon**. These projects involve me, sat quietly with my face pressed against RStudio (I'm writing this blog in the R Dungeon right now!). The problem with work in the R dungeon is that sometimes it's hard to know if I'm making progress or not, and coming up for some sunlight every now and then is essential. 

This is especially true when I have multiple R projects in circulation at once, I wonder if I can have R change my interface theme automatically by project?...

I was stuck trying to find out why the multiple copies of data I have from two API's have different records. I think sometimes to navigate through the R dungeon you have to pick a corridor and start walking! I am going to choose the more credible dataset and progress with my analysis, I think that's a better use of my time than sweating over a few hundred rows. 

I've also been making progress on creating teaching material for my own R course. But it's slow, being my first time creating material like this, it all takes longer than planned. I'm starting to feel a bit more confident about the layout now, and as the document fills out it's starting to look more like a proper resource!

# Glimpses of the sun

I was out of the R dungeon for a few precious hours this week, working on two other projects:

- Starting to plan some new NVivo training material 
- Helping to run some discovery workshops about a new service

I really enjoy the variety of work that I get to be involved with, and it's great to feel the immediate impact of helping a project or service to develop. The human element of working with someone directly and solving problems together is invaluable, and the worst thing about the R Dungeon is the loneliness (and the dementors).

# Did I do it?

Is this a weeknote? Did anyone benefit from reading this? Did I benefit from writing it?
